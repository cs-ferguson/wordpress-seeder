<p>This is an example of how to add a post manually. Generate your block markup and save it as a text file. To add an image, set the src as the filename - the seeder will then look for a matching filename from the images in the `images` directory, and update the src and block attributes to match what has been uploaded. All images stored in the `images` directory will be added to the media library.</p>

<!-- wp:image {"id":0} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="darkplace.jpeg" alt="" class=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<p>The post title is generated from the name of the text file. Taxonomies are randomly added from the list of taxonomies set in the taxonomies.php file, and the publish date is generated randomly (dated 2015 onwards - earliest date can be passed as a parameter when running the seeder).</p>
