<p>This is an example of how to add a post manually. Generate your block markup and save it as a text file. To add an image, set the src as the filename - the seeder will then look for a matching filename from the images in the `images` directory, and update the src and block attributes to match what has been uploaded. All images stored in the `images` directory will be added to the media library.</p>
